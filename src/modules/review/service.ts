   * Atomically claims not-yet-attached review_media rows for a review, via
   * a single conditional `UPDATE ... WHERE review_id IS NULL`, issued
   * through THIS module's own EntityManager/connection - never a
   * connection resolved from the app container. That is the point: this
   * module's manager targets whatever database this module is configured
   * with, by construction, so a consumer who enables module-level DB
   * isolation (a documented Medusa capability) can never silently diverge
   * from it - there is no separate connection to reach across to in the
   * first place. It also means the table/column names below are
   * self-referential to the module that owns this schema, not reaching
   * across a boundary.
   *
   * See src/workflows/steps/attach-review-media.ts for why this can't be
   * expressed through the generated updateReviewMedias(): MedusaService's
   * `{ selector, data }` update form still does its own SELECT-then-
   * update-by-primary-key under the hood and never re-applies the
   * selector's `review_id` condition to the actual UPDATE's WHERE clause -
   * the same race, one layer down, not removed.
   *
   * Returns the ids that were actually claimed - a subset of `mediaIds`
   * when one or more were already attached, whether from an earlier
   * request or a concurrent one that won the same race. The caller is
   * responsible for deciding what "fewer claimed than requested" means
   * (unknown vs. already-attached) and for releasing a partial claim.
